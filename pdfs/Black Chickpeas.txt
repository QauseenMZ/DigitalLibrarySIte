*Boiling Chickpeas
-1st Boil Water and chickpeas (water must be 1 inch above the chickpeas)
-when starts boiling then add baking soda.
-Slow down the heat.
-Foam seems to arise due to baking soda, then you may throw them in sink using 
 a big spoon. (to remove all is not neccessary but the big foams :D)
-After it add ginger garlic pastes, Salt and all spices and tomatoes in the
 same boiling water and let them cook on low heat. 

-Now fry the onions in another pan in little oil until light brown, add it
in the same boiling chickpeas with oil.
-Let them all cook on low heat for approx 45mins to 1 hour and check if the 
 peas are soft enough to be done and water is almost dry.
- then bhoonify the chickpeas until oil comes over and its Done!

Note:	1) If preparing to cook in Cooker, then no need of baking soda, it 
	   can be simply ommitted.
	2) Chickpeas can also be kept in freezer after boiling it with salt,
	   ginger garlic pastes and soda.
	   And later on you may add these defrosted chickpeas in little oil
	   with tomatoes, rest of the spices and fried grinded onions.
	   (At this time, fried onions are also grinded so that they wont be
	   visible while eating, since the cooking time is short for it to
           be soluble ;)
